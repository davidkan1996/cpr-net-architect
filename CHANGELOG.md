# 0.6.2

- Add compatibility with Cyberpunk RED - CORE v0.92.6 while retaining v0.92.4 and v0.92.5 support.
- Publish the maintained fork and release under `davidkan`.

# 0.6.1

- Remove a player Netrunner from the roster on Jack Out, freeing their slot immediately.
- Keep the departed player as a read-only observer; only GM re-admission restores Jack In and runner controls.
- Clear pending rolls, ICE targets and unresolved damage aimed at the departed runner.
- Preserve an empty observer feed when the last runner leaves, including across reloads; the GM can add a new runner or end the run.
- Preserve other players' positions and progress. Re-added runners start at the entry with fresh individual state.

# 0.6.0

- Add up to six player Netrunners to one Architecture, with unique Actors/users and ownership/positive NET Role validation for additional runners.
- Give each runner independent Jack In/Out, position, discovery, failed attempts, Cyberdeck, action tracking, combat target and pending rolls.
- Share cracked nodes, bypasses, NPCs, Black ICE encounters and once-per-run Item pickups.
- Add GM runner selection to the Architecture and NET Combat windows.
- Show teammates only at discovered locations and keep their inventory private.
- Bind ICE targets and confirmed damage to the correct character after GM selection changes.
- Persist all runners through reconnects; migrate legacy encounters; reset/end the group through GM controls.
- Preserve the verified architecture saving fixes from 0.5.1.

# 0.5.1

- Reacquire current compendium documents before saving, avoiding stale storage references after long editing sessions.
- Read back the stored architecture and verify its contents before reporting success.
- Serialize saves to prevent overlapping writes and duplicate entries from the same client.
- Preserve edits made while a save is pending, and keep them marked unsaved.
- Keep failed saves open with a persistent error and allow retrying Save Architecture.
- Read node fields from the displayed node's ID to avoid applying them to another node during selection changes.
- Add seven save regression tests; all 61 automated tests pass. Hosted Foundry testing is still required.

# 0.5.0

- Rename the login datafort heading with the architecture name; blank names default to Night City Datafort.
- Add multiple NPC Netrunner and Demon Actor placements to templates or live runs, with independent connected movement and GM visibility controls.
- Persist placements through reconnects and support import/export, duplication and reset.
- Wrap node names to two lines.
- Preserve the front window during synchronized NETRUN/NET Combat updates and preserve panel scrolling.
- Publish the module ZIP, installation manifest, checksum and updated manual on GitHub.

# 0.4.0

- Always-visible node markers with connections limited to the runner's current incident edges.
- Template and live GM bypass toggles: pass through without cracking or unlocking rewards/controls.
- NET Combat popup with mutual targeting, native player/ICE rolls and GM-confirmed hits and final damage.
- Encounter-only Black ICE stats, current/max REZ and copied Programs; original Actors and Items unchanged.
- GM-controlled ICE movement along graph connections, persisted positions and target clearing.
- Apply confirmed damage to encounter REZ or real runner HP/Program REZ, with duplicate-application protection.
- Preserve player chat rolls, Item pickup, inline journals and optional HTTP compatibility.
- Restore legacy ICE safely; extend automated tests and manual hosted acceptance checks.

# 0.3.0

- Add a GM-only world HTTP compatibility toggle, off by default and requiring all clients to reload.
- Bundle TweetNaCl.js for encrypted, authenticated synchronization without HTTPS-only WebCrypto APIs; retain the default AES-GCM transport when disabled.

- Give actionable startup and mode-mismatch errors; document connection limitations and setup.
- Preserve existing NET gameplay, GM controls, discovery filtering and private chat delivery.

# 0.2.1

- GitHub distribution manifest and release download URLs.
- Capabilities overview, simple manual, and demonstration video link.
- Prominent hosted NET points setup guidance.
- Corrected outdated start-dialog text about player roll dialogs.
- Gameplay behavior unchanged from 0.2.0.

# 0.2.0

- Player-side native Interface and Program roll dialogs with ordinary CPR chat cards.
- One-use GM roll grants, chat-author verification, cancellation, and private DV resolution.
- Take shared Item attachments into the runner sheet once per run; preserve source Items.
